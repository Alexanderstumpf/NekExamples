c                         Moving Wall Example
c      =======================================================
c   
c      This case demonstrates the Nek5000 ALE formulation for 
c      flow in a 2D channel with a moving indentation.  
c      
c      This example has been the subject of several experimental 
c      and numerical studies [1,2,3].

c      A steady parabolic velocity profile is prescribed at the inlet. An 
c      indentation on the bottom wall moves in and out sinusoidally where
c      it's retracted position is flush with the wall.  
c 
c      There are two main non-dimensional parameters given by: 
c      
c      1) Reynolds Number, Re = U*b/nu = 507
c      2) Strouhal Number, St = b / (U*T) = 0.037
c
c      where,
c
c      U := Mean Inlet Velocity
c      b := The channel height
c      T := The oscillation period
c
c      The motion of the bottom moving wall is given by the function
c
c      y = F(x,t) = g(x)*h(t)    
c      
c      where,
c                ----
c                | 
c                | 0 for t < 0
c       h(t)  =  |
c                | 0.5*[1 - cos(2*pi*t/T)]  for t < 0
c                |
c                ----
c
c
c       g(x)  = 0.5*(h_max)*[1 - tanh (a |x| - x_2)]
c
c      With parameters from [1,2]
c
c      h_max = 0.38*b
c      a     = 4.14
c      x_2   = 5.25*b
c
c      The entire length of the channel is given by, L = 40*b.  
c
c      This case is currently setup for Re = 507 and St = 0.037 in order to
c      compare with the experiments [1,2].
c      
c      The ALE formulation for this problem proceeds by solving for
c      the mesh velocity via the Laplace equation, which
c      relies on the maximum principle to give a bounded interpolant. This ensures
c      that the boundary layer elements near the walls are preserved. The bulk of the
c      mesh deformation is pushed into the far field.   
c
c      This case also uses the turb_outflow boundary condition to ensure for 
c      characteristics to exit the domain at the outflow boundary.
