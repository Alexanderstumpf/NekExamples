This is a simple example of two planar shocks at different Mach numbers
interacting with each other in 2D.

A diaphragm is initialized at (0,0) in a domain [-0.5,2] x [0,0.1].

=====
NOTE:
=====

 - A filter is applied to smoothen the initial conditions.

 - The maximum Courant number for this case is set at 0.5.

 - Run 'mkdir profiles' to store the thermodynamic, velocity and Entropy Viscosity
   profiles. 

 - Profile files are written for each processor at a given time. To consolidate 
   all these into a single file, run catalot.sh in 'profiles' folder. 

   Usage: ./catalot.sh <prefix> <time_stamp>
   Available prefix: rho, rhoe, u, v, T, visc
